## Hi!!!!

I'm an alum from Columbia with a degree in electrical engineering and currently work as a software engineer!

My favorite project I am working on right now is a [virtual reality experience with an AI-integrated virtual friend](https://gulnuravci.com/scripts/project_pages/vr_ai_game/vr_ai_game.html)

I'm reading "Machine Learning with PyTorch and Sci-kit Learn"

I maintain a [DSA study guide](https://motley-tennis-c9a.notion.site/Leetcode-b9ff3e506bdb400fad510dafc3b009d8) that people on Reddit regularly request access to (and I hope they use it?) 

Technical info:  
**Languages:** Python, C++, C#, C, JavaScript, GraphQL, Java  
**Libraries/Frameworks:** Node.js, React/React Native, LangChain, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Playwright, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Tensorboard  
**Tools/Software:** Unity Game Engine, Postman, Git, MATLAB, LaTeX
